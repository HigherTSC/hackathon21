# Hackaton 2021 Project
<h1> Introduction </h1>
<p> "We learn by doing - brains are wired through hands on interaction with the world". </p>
To help people in the quest for financial education, our team has developed a feature that would encourage saving, while at the same time bringing a fun aspect alongside positive reinforcement. We believe that a more hands on approach would help the users develop a goal oriented mindset, that would encourage them to save more in the long run. We have incorporated a gamified approach to turn saving into an RPG with achievements, milestones and streaks to keep user motivated via tangible means. Most importantly, we kept CLEO's signature sass in mind, during the design phase. No boredom allowed!

<h1> Technologies </h1>
