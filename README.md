# Hackaton 2021 Project
<h1> Introduction </h1>
<p> "We learn by doing - brains are wired through hands on interaction with the world". </p>
To help help people in the quest for financial education, our team has developed a feature that would encourage saving, while at the same time bringing a fun aspect alongside positive reinforcement. Most importantly, we kept CLEO's signature sass in mind, during the design phase. No boredom allowed!

<p> Python 3.x </p>
<p> Flask 2.0.1 </p>
